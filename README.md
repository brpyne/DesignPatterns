# Design Patterns

This is a spot for me to keep notes on commonly used design patterns.  As I work through learning design patterns I'll include sample implementations of each.  Content (outside of code examples) here will be a mix of my notes and resources online.

## Code Examples

Code examples will be written in C# using the [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.306-windows-x64-installer).

I will be using the .NET CLI with VS Code to run these code examples.  Helpful resource here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet

Frequently used commands:
`dotnet new console`
`dotnet run`
