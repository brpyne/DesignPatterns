# Creational Patterns

- [] Abstract Factory : Creates an instance of several families of classes
- [] Builder : Separates object construction from its representation
- [x] Factory Method : Creates an instance of several derived classes
- [] Prototype : A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- [] Singleton : A class in which only a single instance can exist
